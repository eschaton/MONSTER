2 Initialization_file

  Monster read file MONSTER.INIT from directory where is  executable 
  monster program. Monster gets directory from  process'  image_name 
  entry. There is follow entries:

3 MM_userid

  This entry include userid  of  Monster  Manager.  Userid  must  be 
  written by lowercase. The Monster Manager has the most power. This 
  should be the game administrator. 

4 Example
MM_userid: leino

3 gen_debug
  This tells whether everyone may use the debug command.  It must be 
  able to be disabled  because  it  tells  players  too  much  about 
  monsters.  On the other hand, it must also be able to be  enabled, 
  if we want to do test runs under an unprivileged userid.

4 Example
gen_debug:   false

3 REBUILD_OK
  If this is true,  the Monster Manager can blow away  and  reformat 
  the entire universe.  It's a good idea to set this to false.  This 
  must be true when Monster Manager want use /REBUILD option.

4 Example
REBUILD_OK: false

3 root
  This is where the Monster database goes. The root directory must be  
  world:e and the datafiles Monster creates in it world:rw for people 
  to be able to play.

4 Example
root:    games_disk:monster.database.db>		 

3 coderoot
  The  coderoot  directory  is  where  the codefiles for monsters  go. 
  The directory must additionally have  an  ACL  default world:rw  for  
  files  and ACL rw for the managers.

4 Example
coderoot:games_disk:<monster.database.c>   

3 LEVELTABLE
  Leveltable tells levels of  Monster.  There  is  certain  privileges 
  associateden to levels.  Higger level there is Monster Manager  (not 
  in leveltable).

4 Privileges

  put this to Help structure.

3 Files 
  Monster was written in VMS Pascal under VMS 4.6.  It uses file 
  sharing and record locking for communication.  Outside of that, 
  it doesn't do anything tricky.  However, after playing around with 
  a VMS 4.2 system, I have doubts if it will work on a system that 
  old.  If you've got a reasonably recent version of VMS and a Pascal 
  compiler, you shouldn't have any problems.
 
  The Monster source is in two files:  a short one, approx 300 lines, 
  called guts.pas, and a big one, mon.pas, approx 13,000 lines.  The 
  compiled program contains everything necessary to create and 
  maintain  the Monster universe. There is no separate maintenance 
  program.  Instead,  specific people in the game have priviledges, 
  and are known as the  "Monster Managers".  The MMs can do system 
  maintenance while playing, and  other players can even observe their 
  work.
 
  After reading the document, if you would still like to obtain Monster,
  send me a letter reaffirming your interest.  Thanks!
 
3 Game
 
  Monster is a text-oriented computer adventure game.  Like other 
  traditional adventure games such as Zork and Adventure, Monster 
  players issue simple commands to direct a "puppet" through an 
  artificial world.  Players can explore the world, pick up and 
  make use of objects, and solve puzzles.
 
  However, Monster is quite different from other computer adventures 
  in two respects:  first, Monster is a multiplayer game.  In addition 
  to the normal actions a player can effect on the simulated environment, 
  players can also interact with one another.  Player characters can 
  fight, talk, trade items and explore territory together.  Monster 
  is similar in this respect to some multiplayer games available on 
  computer networks such as the Source and Compuserve.
 
  However, Monster allows players to do something that very few, if any, 
  other games allow:  the players themselves create the fantasy world as 
  part of the game.  Players can create objects, make locations, and set 
  up puzzles for other players to solve.  Game mechanisms allow players to:
 
        o Create and describe new objects and locations
        o Specify how game objects function
        o Provide text descriptions for events that may happen
 
  For example, a player in Monster could create a room named "Great 
  Hall", provide a textual description for it (which other players 
  would see upon entering the rooms), and describe special features 
  of the room (for instance, a brass plaque on the wall).
 
  Here's what another player who walked into the room described above 
  would see (lines beginning with > are the player's input):
 
  > look
  You're in Great Hall
  You're in the middle of a vast hall stretching out of sight to the
  east and west.  Strange shadows play across the high vaulted ceiling.
  The floor is set with smooth rectangular stones.  The walls feel slightly
  cold to the touch, and damp with condensation.  A copper plaque, slightly
  green with age, is set into one wall.
 
  > look plaque
 
  The plaque looks very old and corroded.   However, you can still make out
  the writing:
 
  " Monster, created by Rich Skrenta, 1988.  Play at your own risk. "
 
  Now the creator of the rooms could add a secret passage, perhaps 
  hidden underneath some stones in the floor.  To do this, first the 
  player would describe what the stones looked like, then make a hidden 
  exit to another location with a special command which would activate 
  it.  Here's what the player would see after making these changes:
 
  > show details
  Details here that you may inspect:
      stones
      plaque
  > look stones
  The stones are rough and black, and cold to the touch.  Although the
  mortar work appears to have been expertly done, it has decayed with time.
  Many stones are cracked, and narrow spaces fracture the carefully laid
  pattern.  Some of the stones are quite loose.  You might be able to lift
  one of them with some effort.
  > lift
  With great effort, you manage to lift the stone enough to fit inside.
 
  Once below the stone, it falls back into place, sealing out the light
  from above.  You squirm down the narrow tunnel . . .
 
  This example only hints at the details that actually go into the 
  creation of a realistic game puzzle.  To set up a rich game location, 
  a player would have to
  specify:
 
        o A textual description of the room, as well as separate descriptions
          for various rooms details (in the example above, the plaque and
          the stones are room details)
        o A description of each of the possible exits from the rooms (there
          might be no description if the exit is hidden)
        o What happens when an object is dropped at the location (for example,
          if a player is swimming and he drops something, the object should
          sink) as well as a message describing what happened to the object
        o For each exit, a set of messages and parameters including:
                - the name of the exit
                - whether the exit requires a special object to pass (for
                  example, a door key or some magic object)
                - a message displayed to the player if he can't successfully
                  leave through the exit (if he doesn't have the key, for
                  instance)
                - an optional message that the player sees when he goes
                  through an exit (in the example above, the text "Once below
                  the stone, it falls back into place...." is such a message)
                - a message that players inside the room see when someone
                  leaves through the exit
                - a message that players inside the room see when another
                  player enters the room through the exit
		- special features specific to this exit
                - miscellaneous other parameters
 
 
 
3 Technical_Aspects
 
  Each player who plays the Monster game runs a separate copy of the 
  game.  Each individual Monster process shares a database containing 
  all of the information about the simulated world, including:
 
        o Records describing all of the rooms, interconnections between 
          rooms, objects, and descriptions for the above
        o The locations of every player and object
        o A special shared file used for interprocess communication
 
  Each of the Monster database files are organized as a linear collection
  of fixed-length records.  Monster uses the following files:
 
        roomfile:       file of records containing data on Monster locations
        namfile:        file containing names for objects, rooms and people
        descfile:       file of text description blocks (10 lines maximum)
        linefile:       file of short (one line) descriptions
        intfile:        file of various integer parameters
        objfile:        file of records containing data on Monster objects

                        free/inuse records for dynamic allocation

	spellfile:      contains player's spell information
 
 
4 Record_Locking
 
  When Monster tries to access a record in one of the shared data 
  files, it first makes a read attempt on the record.  If the record 
  is available (no other Monster process is reading or writing it) VMS 
  will lock and read the record and return successfully.  If another 
  process has locked the record, VMS will return an error condition.  
  In this case the Monster process will wait a small random amount of 
  time and attempt to read the record again.  Then if the Monster program 
  cannot successfully read and lock the record after a certain number of
  retries, it prints an error message and aborts.
 
  In initial versions of Monster a count was kept of how many times 
  two processes would "collide" when both wanted to read one record.  
  The random wait dramatically reduced this hit count.
 
  Monster's response time using this scheme is acceptable when the 
  load on the VAX is not too high.  However, it does have some 
  drawbacks.  The first is that a data record being read by a Monster 
  process is locked for a short time, even if the process has no 
  intention of writing to it.  Also, the collide-and-wait approach is 
  somewhat crude considering VMS has extensive record locking facilities 
  which are capable not only of allowing multiple-read access to a 
  record but also of queueing processes desiring to write-lock a record.
  Unfortunately, the use of these facilities requires special VMS 
  priviliges not available to ordinary users.  During testing on a 
  VAX 8800 running VMS 5.1 with over 50 interactive users and 14 
  players response time was fast enough for most picky users.
 
 
4 Interprocess_Communication
 
  Monster processes communicate through a shared file.  A communication 
  from one process to another is referred to as an event; the shared 
  file for communication is called the event file.  Two player processes 
  will only need to communicate if both players are in the same location, 
  since actions in one room won't affect gamers elsewhere.  However, 
  when two or more players are in the same location, quite a lot of events 
  may happen:
 
        o Notification of entry and exit -- players in the room must see when
          other players come and go
        o Notification of various actions -- such as picking up and dropping
          objects, taking inventory and closely examining things
        o Messages when players talk to each other in the game
        o Primary, target and third-party events for fighting -- the player
          throwing the punch sees one thing, the person being hit another,
          and somone else watching sees a third message.
 
  Because only player processes in the same Monster game location 
  need to communicate, each room has an associated event file record.  
  Each event file record contains a circular list of events with a 
  pointer to the most recent event.  When a player enters a new room, 
  either by moving or joining the game, the Monster process reads the 
  event file record for the room and makes a local copy of the current 
  event pointer.  At periodic intervals, the Monster process will reread 
  the event file record and compare its local pointer to the one in the 
  event file.  If they are different, other player processes have logged
  events to the event record, and the Monster process will pull them 
  off the list, handle them, and update its own local pointer.  When 
  a process needs to log an event, it write-locks the event file record, 
  writes a new event, and updates the event file pointer.
 
  There are over sixty different events that a Monster process can 
  initiate or handle; each event can be interpreted differently 
  according to circumstances. For example, player A may whisper 
  something to player B.  Suppose player C is also in the room.  
  Player A's process logs an event containing the message, the event 
  type ("whisper") and the target of the whisper (player B) to the
  event file record associated with their current location.
 
  > whisper b
  >> Hey b, this is something I whispered to you.
 
  Player B's process will receive and handle the event:
 
  A whispers, "Hey b, this is something I whispered to you."
 
  Player C's process will also receive and handle the event.  
  Usually C will only see A and B whispering together:
 
  A is whispering to B.
 
  However, there is a small chance that C will overhear the message:
 
  You overhear A whispering to B:
    "Hey b, this is something I whispered to you."
 
  This method of interprocess communication requires that all 
  Monster processes frequently read the event file to see if any 
  events have occured.  This might seem less efficient than another 
  scheme possibly using VMS mailboxes or shared memory.  Lack of 
  sufficient VMS privileges prevented me from using shared memory.  
  Mailboxes might be more efficient, especially if used with the Vax's
  interrupt system.  However, several problems would be present:
 
        o In order to allow any process to communicate with any other,
          full interconnection would be necessary.  In addition, since VMS
          mailboxes only transmit data in one direction, n Monster processes
          would require 2n mailboxes.  A scheme using mailboxes would quickly
          exhaust process quota limits.
 
        o It is somewhat awkward to set up mailboxes and even more difficult
          to inform other processes of their presence.  Once again, I believe
          that special VMS privileges might be necessary to do this.
 
  The event file scheme of communication has proven flexible and is 
  fast enough when the VAX load is not high.
 
 
4 Maintaining_a_Player's_Existence_in_the_Database
 
  When a user runs Monster, it first checks a playerlog to see if 
  he has ever played before.  If so, the player is restored to the 
  state he was in when he last played, just before issuing the QUIT 
  command.  In the user is not found in the playerlog, he is started 
  out at an initial location, somewhat in the center of the world.
 
  To place a player into a location, Monster scans the room record 
  for a free "person" slot to put the player's index into.  Once the 
  player is part of the room record, he will be visible to other 
  players who are also in that room (providing he hasn't hidden 
  himself), and they will be able to interact with him.
 
  A dangerous situation occurs when a player process dies or becomes 
  disconnected for some reason.  In this case, the room record shows 
  that a certain player is in a location, but in fact there is no 
  controlling Monster process for that player.  There will be no 
  process to handle events directed at that player. This is a bad 
  situation because they player is not obviously "dead" to the
  other Monster programs, as interprocess communication only involves 
  sending an event, and does not provide for receipt acknowledgement.
 
  These "zombie" players were a serious nuisance in an early version 
  of Monster. The Monster world appeared to be full of players, when 
  in fact they were just ghosts left from players typing the VAX 
  interrupt character or becoming disconnected from modems (Monster 
  now inhibits the interrupt character to help prevent the casual 
  creation of zombies).
 
  There are two cases where a zombie game character may be detected:  
  when another player suspects that a game character is not being 
  controlled by a real user (either from a lack of response from the 
  game character or by checking the VAX user list); or when the player 
  who created the zombie character attempts to play Monster again (only 
  one player per account is allow to play Monster at a time, so if a 
  player tries to enter Monster and also appears to be currently playing 
  the game, either 1) two players on one account are trying
  to play Monster at the same time, or 2) the player character that 
  appears to be currently playing Monster is really a zombie).
 
  To handle the first case, when one player suspects another of being 
  a zombie, the player can issue the PING command.  PING sends repeated 
  events directed at the suspected zombie, with short pauses between the 
  sends.  If PING does not receive a response within a certain amount of 
  time (currently about three seconds) it attempts to smoothly return the 
  zombie character to the "inactive" (not playing) state.  This involves 
  taking every object the player character was holding and dropping them 
  on the ground, updating the "time of last play" record and modifying 
  the playerlog to show that the player is not currently playing.
 
  In the second case, when no other player has PINGed away the zombie 
  and the original player (the one responsible for the zombie character) 
  attempts to reenter Monster, Monster will inform him:
 
        There may have been some trouble the last time you played.
        Trying to fix it . . .
 
  At this point, Monster itself attempts to PING the player's character.  
  If two people on the same account are trying to play Monster at the 
  same time the PING will be answered and Monster will not let the 
  second player into the game.  Otherwise, the player will enter Monster 
  normally after a short pause:
 
        All should be fixed now.
 
        Welcome back, Faust.  Your last play was on 13-MAY-1988 at 8:31pm.
 
  Even with this solution, there are still situations where trouble can 
  arise with zombie characters.  For example, suppose a player is on a 
  modem playing Monster and becomes disconnected.  Another player PINGs 
  away the zombie character.  The dialup player calls up the VAX again, 
  and reconnects to his disconnected process.  Now his Monster process 
  still thinks the player character is alive in the room (it has no 
  knowledge of the disconnect) but the database shows that the player 
  is inactive.
 
  If only a few events have been logged in the associated event file 
  record, the reconnnected Monster process will notice the fatal PING 
  to itself (lingering in the event file record) and will abort.  
  However, if many events have occured while the process was disconnected, 
  it will not be aware of the change to the database. This will leave the 
  database in an inconsistent state until the player QUITs the game.  
  Fortunately, when the player quits the database will be fixed.
 
  Since this problem will eventually correct itself (when the player 
  quits) and because checking for this very rare situation would slow 
  response time considerably (Monster would have to verify its existence 
  in the database continuously) I decided to ignore this exception.
 
  I had originally hoped for a smoother solution to the "disconnected 
  player" problem.  In a system where a central process drives all of 
  the player terminals, this is possible.  However, because control in 
  Monster is shared between many identical processes, the problem is 
  much harder.
 
 
4 Reflections_on_the_Project

  How the "Installed Base" Stagnated New Development:
  
 
  During the development of Monster I would periodically change the
  records that held the Monster database.  Once changed in the program, 
  this would render the existing database unusable, as the new program 
  could no longer open the old files.  Thus, I would have to destroy 
  the existing world if I wanted to add any fields to the records that 
  comprised the shared files.
 
  In order to provide a stable environment for players who did not want 
  to see their hard work making Monster rooms destroyed every time I made 
  a change to the structure of the database, I installed a version with 
  a separate set of data files than the copy I worked on for development.  
  Players created rooms and tested the installed version, while I continued 
  to develop my own copy. Eventually, the world in the first release of 
  Monster had about 60 rooms.
 
  About a month after installing the original Monster I replaced it 
  with the new, greatly enhanced version I had been working on (the 
  executable was about 4 times the size of the original) and started 
  over with an empty world.  I had provided expansion fields in the 
  data records for the new release of Monster so I could continue to 
  develop the game without having to work on my own private copy.
 
  The second release of Monster was very popular.  I continued to add 
  features to the program, and made use of the expansion fields when 
  possible.  However, I felt more and more constrained by the limits of 
  my database.  I needed to change more about the data records than the 
  expansion fields would allow. I wanted to erase the world a second time; 
  however, players had put much work into creating over 100 rooms, and 
  became quite angry when I suggested that I might throw away the current 
  world to make a new one.
 
  Some suggested that I write a program which would convert the existing 
  database to a new format.  However, I felt that the work to do this 
  would be much greater than the work I was planning to spend to make 
  enhancements to the game. Also, the style of my changes during development 
  called for small frequent changes. I abandoned the idea of trying to 
  write a translation program, and instead attempted to work around the 
  limitations of the database structure.  Eventually, however, my work 
  stagnated, and new development on Monster ceased.
 
  I never anticipated the work of my playtesters holding back further 
  development. If I were to rewrite Monster, I would use a more flexible 
  storage approach, one probably involving a form of dynamic typing which 
  would let me add new parameters to the database without actually 
  changing the record structure or size.

  Welcome to Monster!  Hit return to start:
   
  Welcome back, Faust.  Your last play was on 1-JUN-1988 at 10:47pm.
   
  You're in Great Hall
  You're in the middle of a vast hall stretching out of sight to the
  east and west.  Strange shadows play across the high vaulted ceiling.
  The floor is set with smooth rectangular stones.  The walls feel slightly
  cold to the touch, and damp with condensation.  A copper plaque, slightly
  green with age, is set into one wall.
   
  Monster Manager is here.

  The plaque looks very old and corroded.   However, you can still make out
  the writing:

      plaque
  > look stones
  The stones are rough and black, and cold to the touch.  Although the
  mortar work appears to have been expertly done, it has decayed with time.
  Many stones are cracked, and narrow spaces fracture the carefully laid
  pattern.  Some of the stones are quite loose.  You might be able to lift
  one of them with some effort.

  > lift
  With great effort, you manage to lift the stone enought to fit inside.
   
  Once below the stone, it falls back into place, sealing out the light
  from above.  You squirm down the narrow tunnel . . .
   
  You're in UnderHall
  This is a cramped, humid room beneath the Great Hall.  The walls are
  dripping with water condensed from mist rising from the baths.  Some
  of the mist follows the ceiling and dissappears up the narrow tunnel.
   
  Stairs lead north down to the Great Baths.
  A neon sign flashes "Great PIB's Lair" over a door to the South.
  You could manage a crawl through a narrow tunnel leading upwards.

  Monster Manager is the stereotype of a computer hacker.  He is wearing
  a flannel shirt with several snickers bars in the breast pocket.  On
  his belt is an ASCII-HEX conversion chart.  On his feet are a scuffed
  pair of hiking boots so he can tackle those dangerous mountains that
  crop up in operations.  Also dangling from his belt is a battered box
  with many buttons on the front and wires with sockets on the ends protruding
  from the back.  The switches seem to have been placed haphazardly, but
  the object is unmistakably one of great power nonetheless.
   
  Monster Manager is in perfect health.

  You're in Great Baths
  These are the luxurious Great Baths where tired adventurers may come
  to relax and try to regain their health and youth from the mineral waters.
  From where you stand at the entrance, you can see below you the bubbling
  soapy pools of water churning violently in tile-lined pits.  The pools
  are fed by hot springs from deep in the rock beneath you.  Steam and
  huge soapy bubbles rise out of the hot pools of water.  The bubbles
  dance through the air, climbing higher and higher, until they either
  burst on the sharp walls of the cave or are lost in the mist above you.
   
  Shallow tiled steps, wet and slick from the hot soapy waters of the
  springs, lead down to the pools.
   
  Rough stone stairs lead up to the south.

  The Monster Vice Manager is dressed in a conservative three piece
  suit.  The stern expression on his face is just a facade, he really
  is a warm and sensitive guy underneath.  He is willing to answer
  any questions and help out with any problems.  He can best be
  described by the phrase:
   
              "Do what thou wilt, so mete it be."
   
  He returns your gaze with a hint of understanding and amusement.

3 Funktiot (suomenkielinen)
  Tm dokumentaatio ei ole ajan tasalla. Erityisesti
  funktioiden parameterien mr ei ole rajoittunut 
  kolmeen, kuten tm ant ymmrt. Tiedostossa
  COMMANDS.PAPER on ajan tasalla oleva dokumentaatio.
4 +
  Funktio: + (p1,p2)

  Laskee parametrien p1 ja p2 arvon.

  Palauttaa arvonnaan p1:n ja p2:n arvot yhdistettyn yhdeksi 
  merkkijonoksi siten, ett niiden vlill on yksi vlilynti. 

  Virhetilanteet: 
     - yhdistetty merkkijono pitempi kuin 1000 merkki
       > Tulos: Parametrin p1 arvo

  Tulkinta:
    p1    - merkkijono
    p2    - merkkijono
    tulos - merkkijono
4 = 
  Funktio: =(p1, p2)
  Funktio: ==(p1,p2)
  Funktio: ===(p1,p2)

  Laskee parametrien p1 ja p2 arvon.

  Funktiot =, == ja === palauttavat ensimmisen parametrin arvon, 
  kun parametrit ovat samat, muutoin tyhjn. Funktioiden tulkinta, 
  siint mitk merkkijonot ovat samoja vaihtelee: = -funktion on 
  tiukin ja === -funktion tulkinta on lysin. = vaatii tsmllisen 
  vastaavuuden, jossa vlilynnit huomioidaan. ==  ei  huomioi lo-
  pussa olevia vlilyntej. === tiivist ennen vertailua vlilyn-
  nit ja muuttaa isot kirjiamet pieniksi.

  Tulkinta:
     p1    - merkkijono
     p2    - merkkijono
     tulos - merkkijono (totuusarvo?)

  Huomautus:
   - Aiempi = -funktio on nyt nimell{ ==. Siis = toimii nyt eri-
     lailla kuin aiemmin. Tosin se nyt toimii niin kuin se oli 
     aiemmin dokumentoitu.
4 inv
  Funktio: inv ()

         essa kuin (toiminnan laukaissut) pelaaja.

  Tulkinta:
     tulos - lista
4 get
  Funktio: get (p1)

  Laskee parametrin p1 arvon.

  Ottaa maasta monsterin mukaan p1:n ilmoittamat esineet.

  Palauttaa arvonaan niiden esineiden lista, jotka todella saa-
  tiin otettua.

  Virhetilanteet:
     - Suorituksessa oleva koodi ei ohjaa monsteria
